# DebugStream
A short, simple program that helps me when debugging Java code. 

Instead of using System.out to print statements, you can use a custom PrintStream object to output data with.
This is useful if you want to see which class outputted data, or if you want to easily toggle which classes or methods can output debugging data.

I included a small JUnit test for fun.
The actual code is so short and simple, it doesn't really need to be tested.
